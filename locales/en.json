While expressing himself might not be his strong suit, he possesses deep affection and is like a steadfast pillar, silently supporting our family.

After graduating, she worked as a capable architect in Korea, but has now temporarily set her career aside to lead our entire family, making the wonderful challenge of a world trip a reality.",
  "member_sung2_p4": "Contrary to her 'Robot' or 'AI' nicknames, SUNG2 possesses a rich artistic sensibility deep inside. She enjoys capturing beautiful scenery with her camera, revealing her side as a photographer with a delicate eye. Possessing meticulous planning skills, a warm heart, and artistic sensibility all rolled into one, this is SUNG2, the reliable leader of our family's journey.",
